				<h2> Feb. 4 - Feb. 11 </h2>
				<p>This week we met with the clients a few times and I did a lot of work on the layout of this webpage you're looking at, and wrote a bit of the Introduction. It took some time to reteach myself CSS/HTML stuff but hopefully this model is scalable and teammates seem okay with it. With my teammates we discussed the direction we wanted to go with the project, deciding tentatively on Python and some RSS/Site-scraping strategies.</p>
				<br>
				<h2> Feb. 11 - Feb. 18 </h2>
				<p>This week we added a schedule page and the hour and tool requirements to the requirements page. We talked more about the direction we wanted to go and aquired an API key. I got one of the previous groups' projects running on my computer so we could look at it and see how theirs came together.</p>
