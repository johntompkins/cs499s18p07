					<h3>Our goal</h3>
					<p>
					The purpose of our project was to provide an easy-to-access database of news articles dealing with Supreme Court rulings. Specifically, we developed a program that looks through various RSS feeds and different news sources and aggregates articles relevant to the Supreme Court, storing them and doing text-analysis on them for later use. The project also includes a front end web application to sift through all of the articles collected. This project was born from a desire to understand the public opinion on the Supreme Court.
					</p>
					<p>
					Our job this semester was combining the work of the previous semesters' projects into one finished product. With two previous groups to work off, we had a large amount of ideas to choose from and adapt.
					</p>
					<p>Our customers are Dr. Zilis and Dr. Wedeking, two political science professors at the University of Kentucky. They wanted to study the public opinion in the Supreme Court over time, but wanted a centralized repository of articles to searhc instead of blindly searching the web for new articles. Our hope with this project is to allow for a concentrated view of the Supreme Court. They will use this web applicaiton to analyze the opinion over time.</p>
