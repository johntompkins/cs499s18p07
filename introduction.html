					<h3>Our goal</h3>
					<p>
					The purpose of our project is to provide an easy-to-access database of news articles dealing with Supreme Court rulings. Specifically, we will develop a program that looks through various RSS feeds from different news sources and aggregates articles relevant to the Supreme Court, storing them and doing text-analysis on them for later use. This project was born from a desire to understand the public opinion on Supreme Court rulings.
					</p>
					<p>
					Our job this semester is combining the work of the previous semesters' projects into one finished product.
