				<h2> Feb. 4 - Feb. 11 </h2>
				<p>This week was started with a team meeting where we discussed specifics of the project, such as what libraries and technologies we will use. I then set up two github repositories. One repository is for us to make changes to the webpage for the project. The other repository is for the project itself. We went with github because of the universality and the ease of collaboration. I then corresponded with our customers to arrange a meeting for Friday, in which we agreed on project requirements. I then updated the requirements on the webpage to reflect these agreements.</p>
				<h2> Feb. 12 - Feb. 18 </h2>
				<p>This week, we met as a team and worked on deciding specifics of implementation of the project. I did a lot of research on different APIs that we could use to access different news articles online. We narrowed it down to NEWS API, which lets users search articles by keyword from over 500 sources. This will be very helpful for the project. I also set up the calendar for the project website, and I added some specifics on the requirements page. </p>
				<h2> Feb. 19 - Feb. 25 </h2>
				<p>This week, we met with our customers to update them on the status of the project. The meeting went very well and we are goingto update so that they know when we present our project for the midterm presentations. I investigated the NEWS api more and got some simple examples working in python to request news stories involving the Supreme Court. I also scheduled the practice with Presentation U.</p>
				<h2>Feb. 26 - Mar. 4</h2>
				<p>This week, most of the work on the project was put towards preparing for the presentation this Monday. I scheduled the presentation U appointment for our team. We met and came up with the presentation early in the week so that we would be ready to present at our practice. The practice went well, and we got good actionable advice that we used to tweak the presentation.</p>
