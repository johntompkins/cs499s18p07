					<h2>March 5 - April 1, 2018</h2>
					<p>
						Over the past 4 weeks, I have worked on the UI of the web application and helped with the test plan. We met in the library on March 25 and worked on the whole project for around 3 hours. I was able to set up a php script page for when the user submits their search form. It is still in progress. The index page of the web application is simple but functional right now; it contains the title, and a form submission template. Once the server was set up to host the page, I was able to visually check everything. On March 26, we met with Justin Wedeking to discuss our progress. He was pleased to hear that the host was set up and the fetching script was working properly. For the rest of the UI, I will be using some snippets of code from the previous group, since they have a reliable way to connect to and retrieve information from the database; the commands are very similar, and this will save a lot of time and effort. I will be working towards a more simplified and straighforward appearance, however, so the customers will be able to navigate through the application faster. This past week, we met again as a group on March 30 to discuss the test plans for the project. We will include Unit, Integration, System, and User testing. What I will focus on is User testing, and some unit testing for the functions of the php script which will retrieve information from the database. Some of the user test cases will be boundary testing, trying to test for as many outliers as possible. For the php script, I must ensure that the function calls are correct and that the return values are accurate to what the user wants and what the database sends back. On April 1, we finished up the test plan page on the project website; I added the sections I was responsible for, noted above, focusing on the user testing.

					<h2>February 26 - March 4, 2018</h2>
					<p>
						This week, I met with the group on Monday with the instructor to discuss the state of the project and the knowledge the customers have on it. On Wednesday, we met to begin work on the presentation. I helped with some of the slides, writing out the introduction slide, as well as adding several small points to other slides as needed. On Thursday, I went to the eStudio with the group and we gave a practice presentation to one of the workers there. He gave us a lot of helpful pointers on how to improve the presentation.

					<h2>February 12 - February 18, 2018</h2>
					<p>
						This week, I met up with the team in the library, where we discussed the webpage requirements for this week, adding the work estimation for each requirement and adding a calendar tool, Google Calendar. The tools and languages that will be used were also included in the updated page. An API key was acquired, and we'll be using an account in Linode for cloud hosting.
					</p>
					<h2>February 4 - February 11, 2018</h2>
					<p>
						This week I made a basic layout of the webpage, starting with the index.html file and adding a short introduction of the project, as well as making a requirements.html file with a list of all the requirements the customer provided us in an email. I also looked at some of the code and brainstormed some ideas about the approach we would take. We have decided to work in Python, since it contains a really useful library for filtering news articles about the Supreme Court for example.
