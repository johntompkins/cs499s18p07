						This week I made a basic layout of the webpage, starting with the index.html file and adding a short introduction of the project, as well as making a requirements.html file with a list of all the requirements the customer provided us in an email. I also looked at some of the code and brainstormed some ideas about the approach we would take. We have decided to work in Python, since it contains a really useful library for filtering news articles about the Supreme Court for example.
