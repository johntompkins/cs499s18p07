					<h2>February 26 - March 4, 2018</h2>
					<p>
						This week, I met with the group on Monday with the instructor to discuss the state of the project and the knowledge the customers have on it. On Wednesday, we met to begin work on the presentation. I helped with some of the slides, writing out the introduction slide, as well as adding several small points to other slides as needed. On Thursday, I went to the eStudio with the group and we gave a practice presentation to one of the workers there. He gave us a lot of helpful pointers on how to improve the presentation.

					<h2>February 12 - February 18, 2018</h2>
					<p>
						This week, I met up with the team in the library, where we discussed the webpage requirements for this week, adding the work estimation for each requirement and adding a calendar tool, Google Calendar. The tools and languages that will be used were also included in the updated page. An API key was acquired, and we'll be using an account in Linode for cloud hosting.
					</p>
					<h2>February 4 - February 11, 2018</h2>
					<p>
						This week I made a basic layout of the webpage, starting with the index.html file and adding a short introduction of the project, as well as making a requirements.html file with a list of all the requirements the customer provided us in an email. I also looked at some of the code and brainstormed some ideas about the approach we would take. We have decided to work in Python, since it contains a really useful library for filtering news articles about the Supreme Court for example.
