					<h2>Analysis of Supreme Court Rulings</h2>
					<p>The goal of this project is to identify, collect, and analyze Supreme Court media coverage from leading news organizations. This is done through a web application which runs a script and uses RSS feeds to add to a database. The application also gives the user control over the types of articles collected.</p>
