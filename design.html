					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The requirements for our project are as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Develop a web application written in html javascript that'll have search functionality via keywords. It only goes through articles we've determined are relevant to the Supreme Court.</li>
						<li>Each article entry inside the database will have columns of data associated with different attributes such as: original link and source information; links to images; text analysis attributes including word count, readability score, sentiment score.</li>
						<li>The above mentioned attributes will be exportable. This will be achieved by implementing a function to output a .csv file with those attributes.</li>
						<li>We will also implement a way to routinely fetch news articles from various news sources. The fetching is done through RSS feeds and NEWSAPI. We've acquired a free API key from NEWSAPI and we intend to implement it's function of searching for news articles that mention a specific topic or keyword. The API has a distinct endpoint which will be especially helpful for us; it is the Everything endpoint, a url (https://newsapi.org/v2/everything) that indexes articles from over 5,000 sources from the past 3 months that have and haven't made breaking news.</li>
						<li>The UI of the application is part of one of the three layers present in the web application. In the visual layer, the UI will present a searchbar with options to set start and end dates for the query. This is similar to the SCOOP project. Once articles are retrieved and presented to the user, there will be a representation with the attributes of the article, mentioned in the second bullet point of this list.</li>
						<li>The other two layers have been introduced already; the data layer corresponds to the database, and the external layer contains the article fetching methods.</li>
						<li>One of our ultimate goals will be to contrive a method to analyze images of articles to identify association with the Supreme Court, using relevant articles' images as a learning tool for future articles tested. This action occurs when determining whether or not to add an article into the database; essentially, we're adding a feature to the learning algorithm, where instead of just using text, images are included.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Environment</h2>
					<p></p>
					
					<h2>Screenshots</h2>
					<p>These shots are of the current python project, which is an effective template for what we are trying to do as well:</p>
					<img src="Capture1.png" alt="Top of search page" width=100%>
					<p>This is the top of the search page</p>
					<hr>
					<img src="Capture2.png" alt="Better look at search page" width=100%>
					<p>A better look at the search page</p>
					<hr>
					<img src="Capture3.png" alt="Result page" width=100%>
					<p>The article result page</p>
					<br>
					
					<h2>Use Cases</h2>
					<ol type=A>
						<li><b>Browsing available articles</b>
						<ol>
							<li><p>User pulls up the website, and available articles sorted by date are already available</p>
							<li><p>User can change 'Sort By' to sort by different heuristics</p>
							<li><p>User can change page number to look at older articles</p>
						</ol>
						<li><b>Searching for a particular article</b>
						<ol>
							<li><p>User pulls up the website</p>
							<li><p>User types a query into the search bar, and may input additional filters to search by</p>
							<li><p>The database processed their query to search through the database for relevant articles</p>
							<li><p>The user's results are returned and displayed to them</p>
						</ol>
						<li><b>Downloading search results</b>
						<ol>
							<li><p>User pulls up the website and searches for articles using process from B</p>
							<li><p>User clicks the highly visible "Download Results" button</p>
							<li><p>A comma separated list of the query results is created and made available to download to the user</p>
